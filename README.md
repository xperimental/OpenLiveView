OpenLiveView
============
*An open implementation of Sony's LiveView&trade; protocol.*

This Android application aims to be a complete replacement for the proprietary applications provided by Sony. Currently this project in a very early stage of development, so it is not suitable for daily use.

Notice
------
The base of this implementation (figuring out the details of the protocol) was done by [Andrew de Quincey][adq], who posted details of the LiveView protocol on his blog and provided a Python server for use on a computer.
